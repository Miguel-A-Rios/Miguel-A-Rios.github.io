                Artifitial Intelligence is a branch within computer science concerned with creating machines that
                are
                able to learn, make decisions, and do endless different types of tasks at a human level. AI does
                this by
                taking in a myriad of data, processsing it, and learning from past behavior to improve. There
                advanced
                forms of AI machines that can learn and grow on their own, independently without human intervention.
                Even the more basic forms of AI can handle complicated tasks that usually need human touch to fix
                small
                erros, so it could need help from a programmer to learn from its mistakes and imporve.
