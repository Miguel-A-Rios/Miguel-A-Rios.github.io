                    Some advantages of AI is as it gets more advanced over time it won't make mistakes or get tired the
                    same was as humans, some benefits include eliminating human errors, saving workers from risks tasts,
                    cost reduction, unbiased decision making, and can make a programmer much more efficient working on
                    code, leaving them with extra time to further improve a program or website.

                    There are some disadvantages like cost of implementation, lack of creativity or emotion, and job
                    automation. Although studies reveal that automation will create more jobs than replace. AI also
                    comes with risks, as AI advances it could cause harm to humans if not monitored carefully if a
                    malfuntion occurs. AI could potentially be used for autonomous weaponry, although there has been
                    several government signatures to not use AI in war or it can cause major harm to civilians.
